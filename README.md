# üöÄ Productivity Increase Due to Alcohol : Visualization üç∫üìä

## Description
Welcome to the Productivity Increase Due to Alcohol Visualization repository! This repository contains Python code for visualizing the relationship between alcohol consumption and productivity. The visualization showcases the effects of alcohol on various physiological and cognitive aspects, including blood thinning, productivity boost, alcohol metabolism, heart rate increase, cognitive function, and their combined effects over time.

## Does Alcohol Increase Productivity?

Yes, alcohol consumption can increase productivity, but only within certain limits and for a limited duration. Moderate alcohol intake can lead to relaxation and reduced inhibitions, potentially boosting creativity and social interactions, which can contribute to short-term productivity gains. However, it's crucial to emphasize moderation, as excessive alcohol consumption can quickly lead to impaired cognitive function, decreased productivity, and long-term health risks. Therefore, while alcohol may have temporary benefits for productivity, it's essential to consume it responsibly and in moderation to avoid negative consequences.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the visualization environment:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Productivity-Alcohol-Visualization.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```
   cd Productivity-Alcohol-Visualization
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can run the Python script to generate the visualization:

```
python main.py
```

This will generate the visualization and display it in a new window.
